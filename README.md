# Creality K1 Bootscreen Creator
 Create bootscreens for your creality K1 from either a youtube video, or gif all from within the same application! 

A half complete Gif to Bootscreen creator for the creality K1

The program/GUI should successfully convert any GIF to a useable bootscreen for the K1, as well as download Youtube videos and convert them to GIF format.

The goal of this tool was to have an "all in one" program that would allow others to easily make as many bootscreens as they wanted(Youtube to bootscreen) to their hearts content. These two features are only half implemented at this time however, until I hopefully find time to come back to this.

In the meantime, pull requests are of course welcome as I would love to see a community bootscreen repository.
